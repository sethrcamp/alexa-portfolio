                     In 2016, Seth worked on the Equipment Checkout System for internal use at the Digital Corps. 
                     The System is comprised of five total repositories and is a full service solution 
                     that completely automated the once paper-only system, allowing students to create reservations, 
                     and check out various pieces of equipment. The system is also completely integrated with Slack, a messaging software, 
                     so that admins can review reservations, and users can be notified of any important events. The 
                     Equipment Checkout System is an excellent example of one of the full stack solutions Seth has worked on.

                     In 2017, Seth was the JPM for the BSU Multisite platform.
                     The BSU Multisite is a platform developed to service Ball State faculty and 
                     staff by creating an easy-to-use website creation platform. As the Junior Project 
                     Manager for the project, Seth's roles were to organize a team of over 20 students, 
                     communicate with the client, and insure a timely delivery of the platform to the users.

                     In 2017, Seth worked on a project for the Career Center at Ball State.
                     The Career Center Certifications System was created for the Ball State University Career Center, 
                     and completely automates the process for both admins and students partaking in their intern and 
                     career ready programs. The system uses ReactJS for both frontends and PHP for the backend. Features 
                     include statistic reporting for admins, organizational tools for the admin approval process, and a 
                     student dashboard to track progress, receive notifications, and submit content for approval.

                     In 2017 and 2018, Seth worked on the Ball State Chirper app!
                     The Ball State Chirper app is a React Native app that promotes school pride through the 
                     use of games, a fight song, custom stickers, and of coarse, the classic chirp button! The 
                     app was a revamp of the original, and is a good example of my work with React Native, specifically 
                     my work incorporating native android modules.

                     In 2017 and 2018, Seth worked on the Water Project.
                     The Water Project was a joint venture with The Digital Corps, 
                     another group of students called The Blue Roots Project, and a 
                     non-for-profit called The Circle of Blue. The purpose of the web-based 
                     platform is to increase awareness of the world-wide water crisis. The platform utilizes ReactJS, 
                     as well as many JS libraries in order to provide an interactive globe, and content management system. 
                     This project is a prime example of Seth's work with Component-based organization, and data manipulation.
